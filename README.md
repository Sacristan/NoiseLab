# What is this?
Library of Noise algorithms with Unity demo. Can be used to generate procedural content, etc.

Currently supported Noise algorithms
1. Perlin
2. Voronoi
3. DiamondSquare

FYI, Some Noise Algorithms have been partially collected across internet few years ago, so i was unable to identify original authors. Feel free to contact me if something is not ok.
